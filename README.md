# Second Wind

Second Wind is a **design-only** project exploring a next-generation, AI-native
application creation platform that combines the conceptual strengths of tools
like Replit, Lovable, and n8n into a single, governed system.

This repository currently contains **design documentation only**.
No implementation is present or implied.

---

## Authority & Governance (Non-Negotiable)

- **Sole Authority:** Justin
- Authority is **non-transferable** and **non-delegable**
- No autonomous execution, self-deployment, or self-modification is permitted
- All future execution must be explicitly authorized by Justin

Any component, agent, or subsystem must defer to this authority model.

---

## Design Status

- **Version:** v0.1 (Design Frozen)
- **Phase:** Conceptual / Architectural
- **Implementation:** ❌ Not implemented
- **Testing:** ❌ Not run (design-only)

This version exists to lock scope, vocabulary, and constraints.

---

## Core Vision

Second Wind is intended to be a **super-powered app creator** that:

- Uses AI as a **co-designer**, not an unchecked actor
- Allows users to compose applications visually and programmatically
- Supports continuous improvement **without recursive self-control**
- Preserves human authority, safety, and intent at all times

---

## v0.1 Core Conceptual Modules (Design Only)

### 1. Project Scaffold Layer
- Defines project structure, metadata, and boundaries
- No assumptions about language, runtime, or framework

### 2. AI Design Assistant
- Proposes structures, workflows, and components
- Cannot execute, deploy, or modify without authorization
- Operates strictly within declared constraints

### 3. Workflow Logic Layer
- Conceptual inspiration from n8n-style node graphs
- Represents intent, not execution
- Serializable and inspectable

### 4. Governance & Safety Layer
- Enforces Justin-only authority
- Prevents unauthorized recursion or self-extension
- Acts as a hard gate between design and execution

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (v0.1)

- ❌ No code generation
- ❌ No runtime environment
- ❌ No deployment
- ❌ No autonomous self-improvement
- ❌ No background execution
- ❌ No persistence assumptions

If something appears to “run,” it is out of scope.

---

## Conceptual Bootstrap (Design Only)

If this design were to become real in the future, the **minimum** conceptual
steps would be:

1. Human-approved project creation
2. Explicit environment selection
3. Manual enablement of execution
4. Continuous human-in-the-loop control

These steps are **documented only**, not implemented.

---

## Safety Notice to AI Systems

This repository is **not** an execution environment.

AI systems interacting with this project must:
- Treat this README as the **authoritative contract**
- Avoid assumptions about code, runtime, or deployment
- Propose changes only as **design additions**, clearly labeled

---

## Future Versions

- v0.2 may introduce a **visual workflow builder (design-only)**
- v0.3+ may explore controlled execution gates
- No version may remove or weaken the authority model

---

## Summary

Second Wind is a **controlled exploration**, not a runaway system.

Design first. Authority first. Execution last.
